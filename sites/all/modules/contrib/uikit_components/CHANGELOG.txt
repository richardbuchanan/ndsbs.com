UIkit Components 7.x-3.x, 08-07-2017 (development version)
-----------------------

Added the X Autoload module as a dependency.
 - The X Autoload module is now required by both UIkit Components and UIkit
   Views. This adds support for Drupal-8-style PSR-4 autoloading of classes.
 - https://www.drupal.org/project/xautoload

   * If X Autoload is already installed and enabled, there is nothing you need
     to do.
   * Users who currently have the X Autoload module installed but not enabled
     need to run Updates on their sites using update.php or drush up.
   * Otherwise you will need to download and enable X Autoload.

UIkit Components 7.x-3.x, 08-07-2017 (development version)
-----------------------

Added the Elements module as a dependency.
 - The Elements module is now required by both UIkit Components and UIkit Views.
   This adds support for newer HTML5 elements, which will be added to both UIkit
   Components and UIkit Views for various theming functions, Views plugins, etc.
 - https://www.drupal.org/project/elements

   * If Elements is already installed and enabled, there is nothing you need to
     do.
   * Users who currently have the Elements module installed but not enabled need
     to run Updates on their sites using update.php or drush up.
   * Otherwise you will need to download and enable Elements.

UIkit Components 7.x-3.x, 06-10-2017 (development version)
-----------------------

Provide separate branches to support both UIkit 2.x.x and 3.x.x library versions
 - In order to support current versions of the UIkit library (v2.x.x and 3.x.x),
   UIkit Components now has different branches to apply the correct theme
   implementations based on the library version.

   * 7.x-2.x/8.x-2.x branches support UIkit 2.x.x
   * 7.x-3.x/8.x-3.x branches support UIkit 3.x.x

   Users will need to install the branch of Uikit Components that supports the
   same UIkit library version of the UIkit theme they have installed. Since many
   of the classes and attributes used by UIkit differ in the two library
   versions, x.x-2.x branches are not compatible with the x.x-3.x branches of
   UIkit Components and the UIkit theme.
