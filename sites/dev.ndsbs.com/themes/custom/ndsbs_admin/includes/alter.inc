 * Modify structured content arrays.

 * These hooks are called after the content has been assembled in a structured
 * array and may be used for doing processing which requires that the complete
 * content structure has been built.
 *
 * If the theme wishes to act on the rendered HTML of the content rather than
 * the structured content array, it may use this hook to add a #post_render
 * callback. Alternatively, it could also implement hook_preprocess_HOOK().
