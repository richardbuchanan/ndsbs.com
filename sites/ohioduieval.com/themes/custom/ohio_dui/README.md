OhioDUIEval Coeus Drupal 7 Theme

We have created two sub-themes for Coeus under ohio_dui: [ohio_dui_core](https://github.com/richardbuchanan/ohio_dui/tree/master/ohio_dui_core) and [ohio_dui_admin](https://github.com/richardbuchanan/ohio_dui/tree/master/ohio_dui_admin). Each are built to inherit from the [Coeus base theme](http://coeus.buchanandesigngroup.com) created by [Buchanan Design Group](http://buchanandesigngroup.com).

ohio_dui_core is the theme that styles the front for the public, staff, and clients. The ohio_dui_admin theme styles the backend for administrtators, stadd admins, developers, and in some cases staff members.
More information can be found in the README.md files inside each sub-theme.
